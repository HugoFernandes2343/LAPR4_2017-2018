**Barbara Csonka** (s1171715) - Sprint 3 - IPC04.2
===============================

# 1. General Notes

This recent sprint required the deep understand of server-client communication in the first place, and using GWT as well. Since IPC04.2 has similarities with IPC04.1, I used my teammate, Rodrigo Fontes's help and knowledge during my work. 


# 2. Requirements

	It should be possible to export the contents of an workbook, spreadsheet or part of a spreadsheet to a XML file. As we want to optimize as much as possible the process the solution should not rely on any third party library. The application should have a window/page to configure the XML tags to use for each type of element. The export should only include the value of the cells. The generated XML should be downloaded to the user local file system.

# 3. Analysis

	The solution of this problem consist of three main parts, such as the Client, Server, and the Shared modules. 

##Server part
	
	DownloadXMLImpl class

##Client part

 	ExportToXMLView class


##Shared part

	DownloadToXMLServiceAsync interface

# 4. Design

## 4.1. Tests

## 4.1. Used classes

# 5. Implementation

# 6. Integration/Demonstration

# 7. Final Remarks
