**Marco Carneiro** (s1160777) - Sprint 1 - Core02.1
===============================

# 1. General Notes

*Considerable difficulty implementing the Extensions Manager given the inability to understand the interaction between GWT and th way the NSheets application loads the extensions.*

# 2. Requirements

Core02.1 - The Extension Manager page should display a basic interpretation of the installed extensions.
           As a User of the Application I want to be able to view which extensions are active/inactive.
           As a User of the Application I want to be able to enable or disable certain extensions.
           Each extension should have a page of its own to change its settings.

**Proposal**:

  - **US1** : User can view and edit the desired extenions it wishes to use in the workbook environment.
  Also update required classes in application NSheets and **shared** packages.

# 3. Analysis

For this feature increment, since it is the first one to be developed in a new project I need to:  

- Understand how the application works and also understand the key aspects of GWT, since it is the main technology behind the application  

- Understand how the Settings Page works so that I may be able to integrate the Extenions Functionality  

- The extension page should display all available extensions for future development   

## 3.1 GWT and Project Structure

**Modules**. From the pom.xml file we can see that the application is composed of 5 modules:  
- **server**. It is the "server part" of the web application.  
- **shared**. It contains code that is shared between the client (i.e., web application) and the server.   
- **nsheets**. It is the web application (i.e., Client).  
- **util**. This is the same module as the one in EAPLI.  
- **framework**. This is the same module as the one in EAPLI.   

From [GWT Overview](http://www.gwtproject.org/overview.html): *"The GWT SDK contains the Java API libraries, compiler, and development server. It lets you write client-side applications in Java and deploy them as JavaScript."*

## 3.2 Application Startup and GWTP

As described before the entry point for the application is the class **pt.isep.nsheets.client.gin.ClientModule**.

GWTP follows the MVP (Model-View-Presenter) pattern. It uses [GIN dependency injection](http://dev.arcbees.com/gwtp/core/presenters/gin-bindings.html) to put together the parts of each MVP. How the GWTP structures the application and uses GIN to bind all the required elements is described in [GWTP Beginner's Tutorial](http://dev.arcbees.com/gwtp/tutorials/index.html).

We can see that **ClientModule** installs the base presenter of the application:

	    install(new ApplicationModule());

The **ApplicationModule** module install all the other modules of the application:

	    install(new HomeModule());
		install(new MenuModule());
		install(new AboutModule());
		install(new WorkbookModule());   

In this iteration of the Core 02.1 we install all the other modules of the **Settings Module** inside of the Setings page:


    @Override
    protected void configure() {
    install(new ExtensionManagerModule());

Each module represents an MVP page in the application.

In this MVP pattern each presenter defines a specific interface that is use to communicate with the UI (i.e., the View). Therefore the presenter can be fully isolated from dependencies related to the UI. For instance, the View interface that is defined by the ExtensionManagerPresenter has several methods:

      interface MyView extends View {

        void addClickHandlerApplyButton(ClickHandler ch);

          MaterialButton getApplyButton();

          MaterialCheckBox getCheckBox();

          MaterialSwitch getSwitchPanelSelection();

      }

The View class is where all the UI code should be implemented. In GWT it is possible to create UI elements programmatically (see [GWT Build the UI](http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/tutorial/buildui.html)). The UI can also be described in .ui.xml files using [UIBinder](http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideUiBinder.html). The NSheets project is using [GWT Material Design](https://github.com/GwtMaterialDesign/gwt-material) and therefore all the UI widgets are from that library.

In the case of the ExtensionManager module we can see that there is a ExtensionManagerView.ui.xml. This file declares widgets. The attribute ui:field can be used to specify an id that can be then used to bind that element to a class in the code. For instance, in ExtensionManagerView.ui.xml:

    <g:HTMLPanel>
        <m:MaterialRow marginTop="60">
            <g:Hyperlink text="Back to Settings"  targetHistoryToken="{tokens.getSettings}"/>
            <m:MaterialLabel text="Basic view of the extensions"/>
            <m:MaterialButton ui:field="applyButton" text="Apply" size="MEDIUM"/>
          </m:MaterialRow>
      </g:HTMLPanel>

It is set the ui:field attribute for two existing labels. In the code ExtensionManagerView.java) one can bind to Widgets classes. For instance:

    @UiField
    MaterialButton applyButton;

## 3.3 Server and RPC

The Home page displays what seems to be Workbooks that should reside in the server.

In the method **onReveal** the ExtensionManager presenter invokes a ExtensionManagerService asynchronously. It uses the base communication mechanism of GWT called [GWT RPC](http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/tutorial/RPC.html).

Basically, it requires the definition of an interface for the service. In this case:

    @RemoteServiceRelativePath("extensionsservice")
      public interface ExtensionsService extends RemoteService {
          ArrayList<Extension> getExtensions();
      }


Note: The @RemoteServiceRelativePath annotation associates the service with a default path relative to the module base URL.

When an RPC is invoked since it is always executed asynchronously we have to prove a callback:

    //Being extensios they are subject to change
	   extSvc.getExtensions(callback);

The callback is simple a class that provides two methods, one for a successful result and the other for a failure:

    //Subject To Change
    AsyncCallback<ArrayList<Extension>> callback = new AsyncCallback<ArrayList<Extension>>() {
              @Override
              public void onFailure(Throwable caught) {
                  //Change
                  MaterialToast.fireToast("Failure");
              }

              @Override
              public void onSuccess(ArrayList<Extension> result) {
                  //Change
                  MaterialToast.fireToast("Sucess");
              }
          };

Since the interface is code that must be accessed by both server and client code it should reside in the **shared** project.

## 3.4 Analysis Diagrams

The main idea for the "workflow" of this feature increment.

**Use Cases**

![Use Cases](us.png)

- **Use Cases**. Since these use cases have a one-to-one correspondence with the User Stories we do not add here more detailed use case descriptions. We find that these use cases are very simple and may eventually add more specification at a later stage if necessary.

**Domain Model (for this feature increment)**

![Domain Model](dm.png)

- **Domain Model**. Since we found no specific requirements for the structure of Workbook Descriptions we follow the Structure of the existing DTO (WorkbookDescriptionDTO).

# 4. Design

*In this section you should present the design solution for the requirements of this sprint.*



## 4.1. Tests

*In this section you should describe the design of the tests that, as much as possibe, cover the requirements of the sprint.*

Regarding tests we try to follow an approach inspired by test driven development. However it is not realistic to apply it for all the application (for instance for the UI part). Therefore we focus on the domain classes and also on the services provided by the server.

**Domain classes**

For the Domain classes we will have a class that represents the entity **WorkbookDescription**. This entity will have attributes that, for the moment, will be based on the class **WorkbookDescriptionDTO**:

	- name (string)
	- description (string)

**Test:** We should ensure that a WorkbookDescription can be created when all the attributes are set.  

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		System.out.println("ensureNullIsNotAllowed");
		WorkbookDescription instance = new WorkbookDescription(null, null);
	}

**Services/Controllers**

For the services the application already has a service specified in the interface **WorkbooksService**:

	@RemoteServiceRelativePath("workbooksService")
	public interface WorkbooksService extends RemoteService {
		ArrayList<WorkbookDescriptionDTO> getWorkbooks();
	}

This method seems to be sufficient for supporting US1 but not US2.

For US2 we need a method that can be used to create a new WorkbookDescription given a WorkbookDescriptionDTO.

The proposal is:

	@RemoteServiceRelativePath("workbooksService")
	public interface WorkbooksService extends RemoteService {
		ArrayList<WorkbookDescriptionDTO> getWorkbooks();
		WorkbookDescriptionDTO addWorkbookDescription(WorkbookDescriptionDTO wdDto) throws DataException;
	}

Tests:  
- The tests on the controllers require the presence of a database.  
- We will use the database in memory (H2).  
- We will have a *controller* from adding new WorkbookDescriptions. This controller will be invoked by the GWT RPC service.
- We will have a *controller* from listing WorkbookDescriptions. This controller will be invoked by the GWT RPC service.

Controller **AddWorkbookDescriptionController**

**Test:** Verify the normal creation of an WorkbookDescription.  

	@Test
	public void testNormalBehaviour() throws Exception {
		System.out.println("testNormalBehaviour");
		final String name = "Workbook1";
		final String description = "Description for Workbook1";
		final WorkbookDescription expected = new WorkbookDescription(name, description);
		AddWorkbookDescriptionController ctrl = new AddWorkbookDescriptionController();
		WorkbookDescription result = ctrl.addWorkbookDescription(expected.toDTO());
		assertTrue("the added WorkbookDescription does not have the same data as input", expected.sameAs(result));
	}

Controller **ListWorkbookDescriptionController**

Note: We will be using the annotation @FixMethodOrder(MethodSorters.NAME_ASCENDING) to ensure the test methods are executed in order. This is useful since the memory database will have state changing between tests.

**Test:** At the beginning of the tests the memory database should be empty, so listWorkbookDiscriptions should return an empty set.

	   @Test
	   public void testAensureGetWorkbooksEmpty() {
		   System.out.println("testAensureGetWorkbooksEmpty");
		   ListWorkbookDescriptionController ctrl=new ListWorkbookDescriptionController();
		   Iterable<WorkbookDescription> wbs=ctrl.listWorkbookDescriptions();
		   assertTrue("the list of WorkbookDescriptions is not empty", !wbs.iterator().hasNext());
	   }

**Test:** If a WorkbookDescription is created it should be present in a following invocation of getWorkbooks().

		@Test
		public void testBtestDatabaseInsertion() throws Exception {
			System.out.println("testBtestDatabaseInsertion");
			final String name = "Workbook1";
			final String description = "Description for Workbook1";
			final WorkbookDescription expected = new WorkbookDescription(name, description);
			AddWorkbookDescriptionController ctrlAdd = new AddWorkbookDescriptionController();
			WorkbookDescription result = ctrlAdd.addWorkbookDescription(expected.toDTO());
			ListWorkbookDescriptionController ctrlList=new ListWorkbookDescriptionController();
			Iterable<WorkbookDescription> wbs=ctrlList.listWorkbookDescriptions();
			assertTrue("the added WorkbookDescription is not in the database", wbs.iterator().hasNext());
		}

**Test Coverage**  
- The actual coverage for domain classes: 61%
- The actual coverage for application(controller) classes: 100%

- TODO: Add more tests to increase the coverage of the domain class.

## 4.2. Requirements Realization

*In this section you should present the design realization of the requirements.*

Following the guidelines for JPA from EAPLI we envision a scenario like the following for realizing the use cases for this feature increment.

**For US1**

![SD US1](design1.png)

Notes:  
- The diagram only depicts the less technical details of the scenario;  
- For clarity reasons details such as the PersistenceContext or the RepositoryFactory are not depicted in this diagram.   
- **WorkbookServices** realizes the GWT RPC mechanism;  
- **ListWorkbookDescriptionController** is the *use case controller*;  
- **ListWorkbookDescriptionServices** is to group together all the services related to WorkbookDescription.

**For US2**

![SD US2](design2.png)

## 4.3. Classes

*Present and describe the major classes of you solution.*

## 4.4. Design Patterns and Best Practices

*Present and explain how you applied design patterns and best practices.*

By memory we apply/use:  
- Singleton  
- Repository  
- DTO  
- MVP  

**TODO:** Exemplify the realization of these patterns using class diagrams and/or SD with roles marked as stereotypes.

# 5. Implementation

*If required you should present in this section more details about the implementation. For instance, configuration files, grammar files, etc. You may also explain the organization of you code. You may reference important commits.*

**For US1**

The UI for this US was already implemented. We simply implemented the server as described previously.

**For US2**

**UI: Button for adding a new Workbook Description**

For this concern we decided to use a Material Widget called Material FAB (Floating Action Button). This is a kind of button that usually appears at the left bottom part of the screen and contains actions available for the elements of the page.  

We updated the HomeView.ui.xml accordingly and declare the element with a tag *ui:field="newWorkbookButton"*. In the corresponding class View (i.e., HomeView) we bind that button to the corresponding widget class: 	

	@UiField
	MaterialButton newWorkbookButton;

We must now add the code that invokes the server to add a new workbook description when the user clicks in the button. This is an event. To implement this behavior we could use GWT Events such as the SetPageTitleEvent already used in the application. These are special type of events that GWT manages and are available to all pages in the application.

We chose to provide our click event globally but to simple use the click event handler of the button and connect it to a method in the HomePresenter.

Since Presenters should only depend on a View interface we added a new method to the HomePresenter.MyView:

	interface MyView extends View {
		void setContents(ArrayList<WorkbookDescriptionDTO> contents);
		void addClickHandler(ClickHandler ch);
	}

Then, we implemented the *addClickHandler* in the HomeView class and call this method in the constructor of the HomePresenter. In the constructor our handler class the server method that adds a new workbook description.   

**Code Organization**  

We followed the recommended organization for packages:  
- Code should be added (when possible) inside packages that identify the group, sprint, functional area and author;
- For instance, we used **lapr4.white.s1.core.n4567890**

The code for this sprint:  
Project **server**    
- pt.isep.nsheets.server.**lapr4.white.s1.core.n4567890**.workbooks.application: contains the controllers  
- pt.isep.nsheets.server.**lapr4.white.s1.core.n4567890**.workbooks.domain: contains the domain classes  
- pt.isep.nsheets.server.**lapr4.white.s1.core.n4567890**.workbooks.persistence: contains the persistence/JPA classes
- Updated the existing class: **pt.isep.nsheets.server.WorkbookServiceImpl**

Project **shared**  
- Added the class: **pt.isep.nsheets.shared.services.DataException**: This class is new and is used to return database exceptions from the server  
- Updated the classes: **pt.isep.nsheets.shared.services.WorkbookService** and **pt.isep.nsheets.shared.services.WorkbookServiceAsync**  

Project **NShests**
- Updated the classes: **pt.isep.nsheets.client.aaplication.home.HomeView** and **pt.isep.nsheets.client.aaplication.home.HomePresenter**  
- Updated the file: **pt.isep.nsheets.client.aaplication.home.HomeView.ui.xml**

# 7. Final Remarks

*In this section present your views regarding alternatives, extra work and future work on the issue.*

Some Questions/Issues identified during the work in this feature increment:

1. The method getWorkbooks in the WorkbooksService returns an ArrayList. Maybe we should not bind the result to a specific collection implementation.
